Atlantic hurricanes are tropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic Ocean between the months of June to November every year. These natural weather formations come in varying intensities and can cause up to billion dollars worth of damage to buildings and properties. The main goals of our project involve examining the effect of several hurricanes on the US airport network through changes in flight cancellations and delays corresponding to changes in the weather and geographical distance away from the center of the hurricane.
