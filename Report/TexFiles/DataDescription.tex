For our project, we used data from three sources.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) (Airline On-Time Performance Data) 
\item National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (IBTrACS-WMO Data)
\item OpenFlights (airports.dat)
\end{enumerate}

BTS data was used to get on-time performance of each flight. OpenFlights was used to get the longitude and latitude of each airport as well as the UTC offset. NOAA was used to get hurricane information. The NOAA storm information is given at every 6 hour intervals. \\

The primary cleaning task we performed was standardizing the departure time in BTS, which was presented as local time to the region, to UTC time with the help of OpenFlights. Then we computed the distance of the origin and destination coordinate to the center of the storm. Afterwards, we merged BTS and OpenFlights on origin and destination coordinates. Then we cut the departure time into the same 6 hour intervals as the NOAA storm data to do the final merge.
